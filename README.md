# Undefine.dev website

Undefine.dev is my personal website/portfolio, consisting of a remix frontend and a strapi cms.

## Installation

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

copy .env.dist as .env in remix and strapi  
create api key in strapi, copy that to remix .env

## Roadmap

- Portfolio of projects
- Autoseed database with example profile data
- Create application specific overrides for profile
- Switch to GraphQL for strapi data fetching
